This query combines recursive traversal with regex pattern matching to find specific reachable pages.

The recursive CTE 'paths' starts with all pages directly linked from 'home' as the base case.

The recursive step joins the current set of reachable pages with PageLinks to find pages reachable from those pages, effectively doing a graph traversal from 'home'.

After building the complete set of reachable pages, we filter using the regex pattern '(ref|polic)' with the ~* operator (case-insensitive match). This finds pages whose names contain either 'ref' or 'polic' as substrings.

The DISTINCT ensures we don't return duplicate page names if multiple paths lead to the same page.
